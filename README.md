# data-duplication-alert-system

**Question Summary:**
In an institute, multiple users often download the same datasets unknowingly, leading to wasted resources like bandwidth and storage. The proposed solution, the Data Download Duplication Alert System (DDAS), aims to address this issue by alerting users if a duplicate download is detected. The system maintains a database with metadata (file names, sizes, timestamps, etc.) of all downloaded datasets. When a user initiates a download, the system checks for duplicates using unique identifiers and alerts the user if a similar dataset already exists, providing details to prevent unnecessary downloads.

**Expected Solution:**
A system that notifies users of potential duplicate downloads by checking a database of existing downloads, providing details like location and attributes, and preventing resource wastage. It should be adaptable across industries, including academic and research institutions.

Here’s how we plan for the automation to work:
1. Data Download Request Initiation

    When a user initiates a download, the system triggers an automation process. This can be tied to any action, such as a click on a “Download” button or submission of a download form.

2. Metadata Check Against a Centralized Database

    Metadata Capture: Before the file is downloaded, the system collects metadata about the requested file (e.g., file name, size, timestamp, unique identifier, spatial domain, etc.).
    Database Query: The system queries a centralized database (repository) that stores metadata of all previously downloaded datasets. This database should be regularly updated with every new download.

3. Duplicate Detection Logic

    The system uses unique file identifiers or specific attributes (e.g., file size, content hash, spatial domain, etc.) to check if the same or similar file has already been downloaded.
    If the system identifies a matching file, it flags it as a potential duplicate.

4. Alert Generation

    If a duplicate is found, an alert is triggered. The user is presented with a notification that includes:
        Details of the previously downloaded dataset (file name, size, download timestamp).
        Location of the file within the system (e.g., folder path, cloud repository).
    The user is given the option to either:
        Access the existing file: To avoid downloading it again.
        Proceed with the download: In case they still want a new copy.
